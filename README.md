Hello there,
Welcome to my Machine Learning Repositry

Here are the List of my work in this;

1.y=sin(x)
Least Square Solution implementation on Sin function.
y=sin(x).

2.Iris Data set
Least Square Solution Implementation on Iris Data set.
In this Example I, extracted Iris Data set from SKlearn Library.
further seperated the whole data set into training and testing units.
Using keras Library applied Least Square solution on the abouve data set.

3.MNIST Data set
Imported MNIST and applied Sequential and Convolutional Neural Network.

4.XOR from Scratch
Applied Back Propagation on Xor function.
